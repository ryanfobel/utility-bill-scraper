## What is this?

The science is clear — global temperatures are rising and we need to drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels if we want to keep our planet habitable for future generations. Many governments around the world are declaring [climate emergencies](https://qz.com/1786781/which-cities-have-declared-climate-emergencies/) and are setting ambitious targets to reduce emissions (e.g., [net zero by 2050](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/), [50% reduction by 2030](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/987667828/how-the-u-s-could-halve-climate-emissions-by-2030)). While broad systemic changes are clearly required, individual action is also important. For those living in the [Global North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South), the majority of fossil-fuel emissions arise from heating/cooling our homes, using electricity, transportation, and the food we eat. It's obvious that we need to rapidly transition off fossil fuels, which will require (1) **clear targets**, (2) **a plan to achieve them**, and (3) **tools for measuring progress**.

There are [many](https://app.projectneutral.org/) [existing](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator) [carbon](https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/) [footprint](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx) [calculators](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/), but they often require manual data entry, leading most people to try them once to get a static snapshot at a point in time. While useful for gaining a high-level understanding of your personal emission sources, it would be much better if this footprint could be automatically updated over time to provide people with **feedback** on the impact of their actions. This project aims to do just that — to assist individuals with collecting data from utility companies (e.g., electricity and natural gas) by automatically downloading their data and converting usage into CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

## Supported utilities

The simplest way to get started is to click on one of the following links, which will open a session on https://mybinder.org where you can try downloading some data. **Note: after you click on the link, it will take a couple of minutes to load an interactive Jupyter notebook.** Then follow the instructions (e.g., provide your `username` and `password`) to run the notebook directly from your browser.

 * [Kitchener Utilities (gas & water)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ryanfobel/utility-bill-scraper/main?labpath=notebooks%2Fcanada%2Fon%2Fkitchener_utilities.ipynb)
 * [Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ryanfobel/utility-bill-scraper/main?labpath=notebooks%2Fcanada%2Fon%2Fkitchener_wilmot_hydro.ipynb)
 
## Install

```sh
pip install utility-bill-scraper
```

## Data storage

All data is stored in a file located at `$DATA_PATH/$UTILITY_NAME/monthly.csv`. The path to this file can be set as input argument when initializing an API object via the `data_path` argument.

```
└───data
    └───Kitchener Utilities
        └───monthly.csv
        └───statements
            │───2021-10-18 - Kitchener Utilities - $102.30.pdf
            ...
            └───2021-06-15 - Kitchener Utilities - $84.51.pdf
```

## Getting and plotting data using the Python API

### Update data

```python
import utility_bill_scraper.canada.on.kitchener_utilities as ku

api = ku.KitchenerUtilitiesAPI(username='username', password='password')

# Get new statements.
updates = api.update()
if updates is not None:
    print(f"{ len(updates) } statements_downloaded")
api.history("monthly").tail()
```
![history tail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanfobel/utility-bill-scraper/main/notebooks/canada/on/images/history_tail.png)




### Plot monthly gas consumption

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = ku_api.history("monthly")

plt.figure()
plt.bar(df.index, df["Gas Consumption"], width=0.9, alpha=0.5)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("Monthly Gas Consumption")
plt.ylabel("m$^3$")
```

![monthly gas consumption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanfobel/utility-bill-scraper/main/notebooks/canada/on/images/monthly_gas_consumption.png)

### Convert gas consumption to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

```python
from utility_bill_scraper import GAS_KGCO2_PER_CUBIC_METER

df["kgCO2"] = df["Gas Consumption"] * GAS_KGCO2_PER_CUBIC_METER
```

### Plot Annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

```python
from utility_bill_scraper import GAS_KGCO2_PER_CUBIC_METER

df["kgCO2"] = df["Gas Consumption"] * GAS_KGCO2_PER_CUBIC_METER
df["year"] = [int(x[0:4]) for x in df.index]
df["month"] = [int(x[5:7]) for x in df.index]

plt.figure()
df.groupby("year").sum()["Gas Consumption"].plot.bar(width=bin_width, alpha=alpha)
plt.ylabel("m$^3$")
ylim = plt.ylim()
ax = plt.gca()
ax2 = ax.twinx()
plt.ylabel("tCO$_2$e")
plt.ylim([GAS_KGCO2_PER_CUBIC_METER * y / 1e3 for y in ylim])
plt.title("Annual CO$_2$e emissions from natural gas")
```
